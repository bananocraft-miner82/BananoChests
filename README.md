BananoChests
==========

Repo for BananoChests, a storage security bukkit plugin for Minecraft.

## Features

BananoChests enables players to lock and unlock chests, barrels and shulker
boxes when placed in the game. This prevents unwanted access to the storage 
and helps to keep the player's items secure and away from thieving hands.

This plugin is a free software licenced under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3.


## Quick guide

- For players, it is very easy: just place the storage item and toggle the locked 
state by sneaking and right-clicking the storage.
- A command is also provided that allows management of a targeted
storage block via the chat window.
- Players can also set a default autolock mode that overrides the server 
default for that player.
- No additional key items are required!
